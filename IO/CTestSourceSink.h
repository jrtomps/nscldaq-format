/*!
 * \brief A source/sink that enables testing of IO operations
 *
 * Often we have applications that are sending or reading data from
 * an IO device. This class enables testing such applications by enabling
 * the ability to load a data source with data that will be read out by
 * a subsequent read operation. Also, you can send data to the device, and
 * then read out what was sent. FOr example, you can ultimately make this happen
 * by doing:
 *
 * \code
 *    CTestSourceSink ss;
 *
 *    union IOInteger {
 *      int   asInt;
 *      char  asBytes[sizeof(int)];
 *    };
 *
 *    IOInteger x, y;
 *    x.asInt = 4;
 *
 *    ss.put(x.asBytes, sizeof(x.asBytes)];
 *
 *    ss.read(y.asBytes, sizoef(y.asBytes)];
 *
 *    cout << x.asInt << endl;
 *    cout << y.asInt << endl;
 * \endcode
 *
 *  Because you can overload the << and >> operators, you can easily make this
 *  much more intuitive to work with than the IOInteger implementation above. See
 *  the FormattedIO library for overloads of common types.
 *
 *  At the heart of this class is a vector of bytes. It is used to store data that
 *  has been put into the object. When data is read from it, the data is removed. So
 *  it acts essentially as a queue.
 *
 * \todo Implement based on a std::queue rather than a std::vector
