/*! \brief Construct a ring item from a range of contiguous byte data
 *
 * \param beg   points to data representing the beginning of the ring item (i.e. the size)
 * \param end   points to the address immediately after valid contiguous byte data
 *
 *
 * At present, this is a bit wasteful of CPU cycles because it performs an extra copy.
 * It would be much more efficient if we constructed directly from the range.
 *
 * In any case, it is expected that the range of bytes [beg, end), represent
 * a complete ring item. It is not an error for the range to be larger than the
 * ring item pointed to by beg. In that case, only the first ring item is extracted
 * and returned.
 *
 * The returned item is a CRingItemUPtr(i.e. unique_ptr), so ownership is explicitly passed to the caller.
 * Typically, users will want to immediately convert this to a CRingItemPtr (i.e. shared_ptr), because
 * that is more in line with how people typically will use it. The semantics
 * of a CRingItemPtr are much more natural and simpler. Here is the recommended
 * usage:
 *
 * \code
 * #include "V12/CRingITemFactory.h"
 *
 * using namespace DAQ::V12;
 *
 * CRingItemPtr pItem = CRingItemFactory::createRingItem(buffer.begin(), buffer.end());
 *
 * \endcode
 *
 * The fact that this is a templated function means that you can call it with any
 * iterator type that refers to byte data. In other words, char*, unsigned char*,
 * const char*, const unsigned char*, uint8_t*, const uint8_t*, std::vector<char>::iterator,
 * std::array<char>::iterator, etc... will all work.
 *
