  \file DataFormat.h
  This file contains typedefs for the structures that represent leaf ring items.
  An item has the structure:

\verbatim
 +----------------------------------+
 |  Size of item in bytes (32 bits) |
 +----------------------------------+
 |  32 bit type code of item        |
 +----------------------------------+
 |  64 bit event timestamp          |
 +----------------------------------+
 |  32 bit source id                |
 +----------------------------------+
 |  body (size - 8 bytes of data    |
 +----------------------------------+
\endverbatim

 Where the 32 bit type code is really a 15 bit type code stored in the lower 15 bits of the
32 bit word in the native byte ordering of the originating system.  This allows it to serve as 
a byte order indicator, as data type 0 is not legal, and the top bits of the type code must
be zero.

New in version 12.0 is the ability for ring items to nest. As a result, a ring item can
contain a series of ring items in its body. There is therefore a distinction between
ring items that are leafs and composites. You can think of a ring item as representing
a tree structure. Often we like to diagram these as shown below:

\verbatim

                * (composite)
               / \
  (composite) *   * (leaf)
             / \
     (leaf) *   * (leaf)

\endverbatim

Each node in the graph has an associated ring item header that specifies a size,
type, source id, and event timestamp. The body of a composite is just a series of
ring items, whereas the body of a leaf has some predefined structure.

Composite and leaf types are differentiated by bit 16 of the type code. If set,
the item is composite. Otherwise, it is a leaf. The concept of type consistency is also
part of version 12.0. The rule of type consistency is that all children of a parent
ring item must have the same fundamental type (only least significant 15 bits included).

In version 12.0, the support for the C-style structs is limited. The user is encouraged
to use the CRingItem class and its derived types. Those classes are suitable for IO
and general usage moreso than the structs provided in this header.
