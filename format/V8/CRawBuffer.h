     *
     * The CRawBuffer is a class that is intended to provide a minimum set of common
     * functionality to a body of bulk, raw data. In this case, it stores the raw
     * data (unparsed), a parsed header, and also a flag determining whether the 
     * data in the unparsed buffer should be swapped. It's intent is to provide
     * the basic IO functionality required by buffers. There are overloads of the 
     * insertion(<<) and extraction (>>) operators that work with this form of 
     * the data.
     *
     * Every specialized buffer type (i.e. derived classes of CV8Buffer) can be
     * constructed from a CRawBuffer. They can also serialize their data into a 
     * CRawBuffer.
